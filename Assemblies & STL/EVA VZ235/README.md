## Due to the slightly different belt routing of the VZ330 and VZ235 the standard EVA platform can't be used. VZ235 and VZ330 both use their own modified version

all printed parts have been put into folders seperated by supported platform. 
to find all parts needed one will need to download all parts in the folder fitting their respective build options

Step 1: Choose to use the fan ducting for EVA 2.3 or 2.4

Step 2: choose the hotend 

Step 3: choose extruder combo (the standard loadout is the hextrudort version which will be found in universal parts folder as it will fit both 2.3 and 2.4)

Step 4: print and have fun!
