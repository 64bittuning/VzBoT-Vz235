## due to the slightly different belt routing of the VZ330 and VZ235 the standard EVA platform can't be used. VZ235 and VZ330 both use their own modified version

all printed parts have been put into folders seperated by supported platform. 
to find all parts needed one will need to download all parts in the folder fitting their respective build options
