* A .svg that displays the Vzbot Logo.

On the Bed Shape window click on the Load button in the Texture section and choose the Texture you downloaded from here. Repeat the same for the Model section where you upload the bed assembly.

If you have selected both proberly the names of the files will appear in the window. If you see the names you can click on OK and confirm your choice. If you now switch back to the 3D view Tab. It will take a moment, because that is the moment where the texture and the bed assembly model will be loaded into the program. If everything works and looks how you wanted it, make sure to save your Printer settings.
