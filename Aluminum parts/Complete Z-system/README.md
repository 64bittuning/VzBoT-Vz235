For instructions, BOM and STL list: see the pdf manual above

Both VZ330 and VZ235 share the same Z-system, though not all parts are the same for both. 
The manual covers both as functional the only difference between the two is the chain mount. 
Do mind when ordering the kit that you order the right one specific to your machine!
