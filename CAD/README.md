## Due to the large file sizes of .step files it is required to zip the files before uploading to github
After downloading the folder can be unpacked with 7-Zip (https://www.7-zip.org/)

For those not familiar with CAD software, we recommend using Fusion360 to open the step files
Do not feel intimidated by the sheer amount of parts or complexity
linked below are some video's to get started in Fusion360
